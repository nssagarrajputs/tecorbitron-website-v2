        question: "How long does it take to build a website?",
        answer: "Most business websites take 2–4 weeks. E-commerce platforms or complex web apps take 4–8 weeks. We always give you a clear timeline before starting, and we stick to it.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is your pricing? Do you have fixed packages?",
        answer: "We offer three engagement models — Fixed Price (starting ₹25,000), Monthly Retainer (starting ₹15,000/mo), and Dedicated Resource (custom). All pricing is transparent with no hidden costs.",
    },
    {
        question: "How many revisions do I get?",
        answer: "All projects include at least 2 rounds of revisions. For design projects, we do revisions until you're happy — within the agreed scope. We want you to love what we build.",
    },
    {
        question: "What technologies do you use?",
        answer: "We primarily use Next.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS for web. React Native for mobile. Figma for design. We choose the best tool for each project — not just what we're comfortable with.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you provide support after the project is delivered?",
        answer: "Yes. Every project includes 30 days of post-launch support. Beyond that, we offer AMC (Annual Maintenance Contracts) and monthly retainer plans to keep your product running smoothly.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can you work with our existing team or codebase?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We regularly work alongside in-house teams, integrate with existing codebases, and adapt to your tools and workflows. We're flexible.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you work with international clients?",
        answer: "Yes. We work with clients across India, USA, UK, UAE, and beyond. We're comfortable with different time zones and communicate in English. Payments in multiple currencies accepted.",
    },
    {
        question: "What if I'm not sure which service I need?",
        answer: "Book a free 30-minute discovery call. We'll understand your goals and recommend the right solution — honestly, even if that means telling you what you don't need.",
    },
    {
        question: "Are you a registered company?",
        answer: "Yes. We are Tecorbitron Solutions Pvt. Ltd., incorporated in August 2024, GST registered, and based in Ghaziabad, NCR, India. Full company details available on our About page.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do we communicate during the project?",
        answer: "We keep it simple — WhatsApp for quick updates, email for formal communication, and weekly video calls for project reviews. You always know what's happening.",
